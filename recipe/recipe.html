    <h1>How to make Fondue</h1>
    <img src="fondue.webp" alt="Picture of fondue.">
    <p>Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make fondue at home: Bring wine to a simmer in a fondue
        pot, mix in the flour, then mix in the cheeses. Season with nutmeg and salt.
        Serve this top-rated cheese fondue with cubed French bread, meat, potatoes, sliced fruit (such as apples),
        vegetables (such as cauliflower, broccoli, and sliced bell peppers), crackers, chips, or pretzels.
